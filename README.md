## Description
Pay-Up is a platform to split group costs and accurately determine how much the individuals owe to one another. 

Sometimes it can get very difficult to determine how much each person in a group owes. 

For instance, roommates share a great deal of the living expenses and it can get hard to keep track of the exact amounts each person is spending. Our project focuses to solve such issues and make it easier to fairly distribute the amounts that need to be distributed. 

## Usage

- Technologies used: 
    - Foundation stylesheet & CSS
    - Data storage
    - Geocoding & One Weather API
    - Currency exchange rate convert USD to EUR option (in case you are traveling!)

- Breakdown of tasks and roles:
    - Each group member created their own branch, tasks were assigned, and then as work got completed updates were merged into the main branch.

- Challenges:
    - Working JavaScript code 
    - Eliminate bugs and streamline non-essential code

- Successes:
    - Practical use
    - Simple yet functional
    - Group collaboration

## Future Development - ### The Endless possibilities!

- Future development will require the use of APIs and additional coding to support features, which does not limit to,
    - Saving data
    - Share the result via text or email
    - Currency exchanges
    - Currency-api
    - NFT trading capabilities
    - Creating the ability to link contacts allowing text
    - Cryptocurrency exchange (including NFT)
    
- How will this be done!â€¦
    - Implementing chatting features
    - Finding an api similar to what websites like metamask uses Ethereum API
